# Code Style Preferences

## Comment Guidelines

- Keep comments minimal and only when necessary
- Avoid adding progress comments while coding
- Don't add excessive documentation unless explicitly requested
- Prioritize clean, self-documenting code over verbose comments
- Only add detailed comments when the user specifically asks for them

## General Approach

- Focus on concise, readable code
- Let the code speak for itself when possible
- Add comments only for complex logic or when clarification is needed
- Always replace old implementations completely - don't keep previous code for compatibility
- Remove deprecated or unused code rather than commenting it out
